We have this repo for RESTAPI Integration using python, where we took a use case of student management owner portal,

Required or Needed products:
1.Python latest version installed in your local system
2.We have used VS Cosde IDE to implement this project, in which we used environment called "venv" instead of "conda" beacause we need to use flask to implement this REST API's
3.Please refer to this link to setup VS code with environment "https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask"

As part of project we have used python modules for flask like "flask", 

Implementaion steps:
1. We have setup the VS Code environment,
2. Succesed to install all required modules in VS code throught VS Code Terminal, by command "pip install "<module_name>"
3. Initialzed flask instance by above link, we have complement Infra setup now,
4. We took various examples to get familier with flask, and at last we ended implementing our project with swagger UI module with flask,
